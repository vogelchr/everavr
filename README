So one day, I found a rather big Everbouquet MG24065G LCD in the dumpster,
but besides some (rather bad) scratches on the front, the rest of it looked
pristine... And indeed, after a few hours of tinkering, the thing works.

To use this code, you have to do the following:

 - build yourself a small PCB that connects the mega168 to the LCD;
   the pinout is shown in the top comment of everavr.c.
   I prefer ghetto perfboard style, as shown here

 - Burn the AVR fuses so that it runs with 8 MHz (for other clock- and
   baud-options, adjust UBRR0, U2X0, ..). Currently my schematic
   has pins for a external XTAL and possible USB connection on pins 4,5
   left unused.

 - Connect your PC's serial port via a suitable level converter to
   pins 2 & 3 of the AVR. I used a FT232R usb-to-serial board from
   sparkfun electronics.

 - Don't forget to provide the LCD with the correct LCD bias voltage
   and adjust the contrast (pins Vcc, Vee, Vo on the LCD, see everavr.c).

If you send any ASCII character at 115200 bps to the lcd, it should show
up in the upper left corner. The serial protocol currently implemented is
also explained in everavr.c (see the protocol state machine in eat_char).
